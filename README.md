# Advent of Code in Java

This is a starter project to help new programmers with using 
Java for solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository
2. Check it out to a place on your hard drive
3. Open it up with the Java IDE of your choice, such as [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Where to put things

1. Create a class in `src/main/java/org/tot/aoc` for each day's solution, i.e. `Day1.java`.
2. Create a corresponding test class in `src/test/java/org/tot/aoc`, i.e. `Day1Test.java`.
3. Add any input files to `src/test/resources`.

## Running the puzzles

1. Once you've coded up your solution, run the corresponding unit test in your IDE (IntelliJ has a little play triangle to the left)
2. For samples, you should assert the value that the puzzle gave you
3. Run the sample input firat to make sure your code can at least solve the sample
4. For the real solution, first assert a dummy number, like 0, in the test
5. The test will fail, but it will tell you what the actual result was
